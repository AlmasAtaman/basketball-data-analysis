# Basketball Data Analysis
**Note:** This repository only contains UI design mockups for the final project. Our team is currently on break, but we plan to resume development in the future. Since we aim to launch this as a professional website, the codebase is private.

This project was developed as part of a team effort focused on NBA data analysis and player data visualization.  
The goal was to build an interactive web application that helps users analyze player data/trades, compare player stats, and simulate outcomes using live data from Google Sheets.

In this directory, you’ll find a few of the UI mockups I contributed to.

**My Role**
- Creating mockups and UI components using **Figma**
- Designing a responsive user interface for the web app
- Collaborating with backend developers to structure the app’s data flow
- Organizing NBA player data in Google Sheets, integrating it using **Google Sheets API**
